			<h2>Hey there,</h2>
			<p>I am a <strong>Senior Product Designer</strong> with <a href="https://txidigital.com">TXI</a> in Chicago. I collaborate with talented engineers and product managers to create custom software solutions for our clients.</p>
			<p>Our expertise lies in crafting exceptional Rails and React applications tailored to meet our clients' unique needs.</p>
			<p>My journey began over a decade ago, when I enrolled in one of the first web bootcamps in 2011, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-starter-league/">The Starter League</a>.</p>
			<p>This transformative experience ignited my passion for web development and set me on the path to where I am today.</p>

			<p>Following the bootcamp, I transitioned into front-end development and channeled my expertise through mentoring startups at <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/chicago">Techstars</a>.</p>
			<p>In 2014, my growing interest in interaction design led me to join the team at Drawn.</p>
			<p>Seeking to expand my design strategy and research capabilities, I joined <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravitytank/">gravitytank</a> in 2016.</p>
			<p>This company was subsequently acquired by the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/ignite/">Salesforce Ignite</a> team, further enriching my professional journey.</p>
			<p>Today, I am committed to continually refining my web development and design skills, staying current with industry trends, and delivering outstanding solutions to our clients at TXI.</p>
